# YIT-${input.id}: ${input.title}

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded by YIT-YYY]

## Context
- What problem are we solving?  
- Why is this decision needed now?  
- Relevant project scope (Yithian App = Call of Cthulhu 7e character sheet).  
- Any rules or UX constraints that apply (e.g. CoC 7e mechanics, Provider MVVM architecture, dark atmospheric UI, no snackbars, package imports only).  
- Link to roadmap item, bug report, or discussion if available.

## Decision
- The choice we made.  
- Describe *what exactly changes* (model, UI, rules enforcement, persistence, etc.).  
- Keep it short and precise.

## Alternatives Considered
- Option A – why rejected.  
- Option B – why rejected.  
- Option C – (if relevant).  
Keep this brief; just enough to explain reasoning.

## Consequences
- **Positive:** benefits, why this helps.  
- **Negative:** trade-offs, complexity, migrations needed.  
- **Impact on rules compliance:** Does it follow CoC 7e RAW or house rule?  
- **Impact on UX:** any adjustments to Skills/Attributes/Dice Roller.  
- **Impact on persistence:** Hive migrations, JSON schema updates.

## Follow-ups
- [ ] Code changes required (files/modules).  
- [ ] Update roadmap
- [ ] Update assets
- [ ] Add or update unit tests.
